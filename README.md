# OpenShift CI/CD Final Project

This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline using:

- GitHub Actions (CI)
- flake8 for linting
- nose for unit testing
- Tekton pipelines (CD)
- OpenShift deployment
- Updated for CI validation

The pipeline automatically builds, tests, and deploys the application.
